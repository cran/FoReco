# FoReco 0.2.0

##### Major changes
* It's possible to use a subset of factors of *m* (max. order of temporal aggregation);
* Added the possibility for `htsrec()`, `thfrec()` and `octrec()` to introduce a list of *h* covariance matrices in the parameters `W` and `Omega`, where *h* stands for the forecast horizon (note that for `thfrec()` and `octrec()` this is the forecast horizon of the entire cycle);
* Param `Sstruc` is no more avaible in `octrec()` and `ctf_tools()`. FoReco uses a fast algorithm to compute **Scheck**, so no external input is needed;
* Modified output of `ctf_tools()` (added `Ccheck`, `Htcheck`, `Scheck`, removed `Cstruc`, `Sstruc`), `hts_tools()` (added `C`) and `thf_tools()` (added `m`);
* Added two new not negative reconciliation techniques ("**KAnn**" and "**sntz**") with a new parameter (`nn_type`) in `htsrec()`, `thfrec()` and `octrec()`;
* Added the top-down reconciliation function `tdrec()`;
* Added the level conditional forecast reconciliation (with and without not-negative constraints) for genuine hierarchical/grouped time series `levrec()` (cross-sectional, temporal and cross-temporal).

##### Minor changes
* Now in `octrec()` it is also possible to introduce the **Î©** covariance matrix variant through the `Omega` parameter and not only the **W** variant with the `W` parameter;
* Updated `tcsrec()`, `cstrec()` and `iterec()`. In the iterec function the `maxit` parameter has been replaced by `itmax`, however for the moment `maxit` is still supported;
* Now FoReco removes null rows from the cross-sectional aggregation matrix **C** and it warns the user if the balanced version of an unbalanced hierarchy is considering duplicated variables;
* Redesigned the console output and added a new convergence norm as *default* for `iterec()` (`norm` parameter).

##### Experimental
* Add the possibility to introduce constraints through the `bounds` param in `htsrec()`, `thfrec()` and `octrec()`;
* Add a function `oct_bounds()` to organize the bounds on a specific dimension (i.e. only cross-sectional or only temporal) in a cross-temporal framework;
* Added `ut2c()` and `srref()` to develop a cross-sectional structural representation starting from a zero constraints kernel matrix;
* Added in `score_index()` the calculation of multiple forecast horizons index (like 1:6) and multiple cross-sectional levels for a forecasting experiment.
