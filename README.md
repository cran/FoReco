The **FoReco** (**Fo**recast **Reco**nciliation) package is designed for
point forecast reconciliation, a **post-forecasting** process aimed to
improve the accuracy of the base forecasts for a system of linearly
constrained (e.g.Â hierarchical/grouped) time series.

It offers classical (bottom-up and top-down), and modern (optimal and
heuristic combination) forecast reconciliation procedures for
cross-sectional, temporal, and cross-temporal linearly constrained time
series.

The main functions are:

-   `htsrec()`: cross-sectional (contemporaneous) forecast
    reconciliation.
-   `thfrec()`: forecast reconciliation for a single time series through
    temporal hierarchies.
-   `lccrec()`: level conditional forecast reconciliation for genuine
    hierarchical/grouped time series.
-   `tdrec()`: top-down (cross-sectional, temporal, cross-temporal)
    forecast reconciliation for genuine hierarchical/grouped time
    series.
-   `ctbu()`: bottom-up cross-temporal forecast reconciliation.
-   `tcsrec()`: heuristic first-temporal-then-cross-sectional
    cross-temporal forecast reconciliation.
-   `cstrec()`: heuristic first-cross-sectional-then-temporal
    cross-temporal forecast reconciliation.
-   `iterec()`: heuristic iterative cross-temporal forecast
    reconciliation.
-   `octrec()`: optimal combination cross-temporal forecast
    reconciliation.
