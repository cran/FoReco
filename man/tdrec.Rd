\title{Top-down forecast reconciliation for genuine hierarchical/grouped time series}
\usage{
tdrec(topf, C, m, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{topf}{(\mjseqn{h \times 1}) vector of the top-level base forecast to be
disaggregated; \mjseqn{h} is the forecast horizon (for the lowest temporal
aggregation order in temporal and cross-temporal cases).}

\item{C}{(\mjseqn{n_a \times n_b}) cross-sectional (contemporaneous) matrix
mapping the \mjseqn{n_b} bottom level series into the \mjseqn{n_a} higher level ones.}

\item{m}{Highest available sampling frequency per seasonal cycle (max. order
of temporal aggregation, \mjseqn{m}), or a subset of the \mjseqn{p} factors
of \mjseqn{m}.}

\item{weights}{vector of weights to be used to disaggregate topf:
(\mjseqn{n_b \times h}) matrix in the cross-sectional framework;
(\mjseqn{m \times h}) matrix in the temporal framework;
(\mjseqn{n_b m \times h}) matrix in the cross-temporal framework.}
}
\value{
The function returns an (\mjseqn{h \times n}) matrix of
cross-sectionally reconciled forecasts, or an (\mjseqn{h(k^\ast + m) \times 1})
vector of top-down temporally reconciled forecasts, or an
(\mjseqn{n \times h (k^\ast + m)}) matrix of top-down
cross-temporally reconciled forecasts.
}
\description{
\loadmathjax
Top-down forecast reconciliation for genuine hierarchical/grouped time series,
where the forecast of a `Total' (top-level series, expected to be positive)
is disaggregated according to a proportional scheme given by a vector
of proportions (weights).
Besides the fulfillment of any aggregation constraint,
the top-down reconciled forecasts should respect two main properties:
\itemize{
  \item the top-level value remains unchanged;
  \item all the bottom time series reconciled forecasts are non-negative.
}
The top-down procedure is extended to deal with both temporal and cross-temporal cases.
Since this is a post-forecasting function, the vector of weights must be given
in input by the user, and is not calculated automatically (see Examples).
}
\details{
Fix \mjseqn{h = 1}, then
\mjsdeqn{\widetilde{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{S}\mathbf{w}\widehat{a}_1}
where \mjseqn{\widetilde{\mathbf{y}}} is the vector of reconciled forecasts,
\mjseqn{\mathbf{S}} is the summing matrix (whose pattern depends on which type
of reconciliation is being performed), \mjseqn{\mathbf{w}} is the vector of weights,
and \mjseqn{\widehat{a}_1} is the top-level value to be disaggregated.
